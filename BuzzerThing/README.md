# Buzzer App
So I saw this youtube video where a kid shares his experience in a class with a *certain service whose name I shall not mention* that *just so happens to teach coding to kids* and the kid had to make a "Buzzer App"

And yeah I decided to make this so I can call myself a Certified Game Developer or a Space Science Programming Expert or whatever idk

Ah yes \[REDACTED\] is an extremely useful service which you totally should pay a buttload of money to :)
